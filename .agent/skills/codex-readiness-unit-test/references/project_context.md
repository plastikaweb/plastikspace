Evaluate whether the AGENTS documentation in the current working directory provides clear context with explicit paths.

Definition of PASS:

- The AGENTS docs include explicit paths to important directories/files (e.g., services/auth, src/, Makefile, pyproject.toml).
- Each path has a short context for what it is used for.

Definition of FAIL:

- No explicit paths, or only vague prose without concrete paths.

Use the evidence snippets in the evidence JSON.

Return STRICT JSON only with this schema:
{
"status": "PASS|WARN|FAIL|NOT_RUN",
"rationale": "string",
"evidence_quotes": [{"path":"...", "quote":"..."}],
"recommendations": ["..."],
"confidence": 0.0
}

Rules:

- Evidence quotes must be exact excerpts from files; keep each quote short (<240 chars).
- No patches or diffs in recommendations.
- If the docs contain some paths but lack context, use WARN.
- If no AGENTS content is available, use FAIL.
