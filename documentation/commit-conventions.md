## Introduction

We use [commitizen](https://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli/) to apply some simple formatting rules for our commit messages.

The main types of commitizen available are those corresponding to the [cz-customizable](https://github.com/leoforfree/cz-customizable) plugin.

```bash
feat(shared-button): #54 add Notifications button

Allow users to toggle particular notifications by app section.

Sets user properties to identify whether to send notifications and reminders to particular user.

ISSUES CLOSED: #54
```

## Commit execution

```bash
cz
// Not recommended:
// add --no-verify flag to skip any hook before the commit resolution
```

### Commitizen steps

#### 1. Type

The type is the main category of your change.

Default list:

- feat: A new feature.
- fix: A bug fix.
- docs: Documentation only changes.
- style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc).
- refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.
- perf: A code change that improves performance.
- test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests.
- build: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm).
- ci: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs).
- chore: Other changes that don't modify src or test files.
- revert: Reverts a previous commit.

#### 2. Scope (optional)

It describes the project, library, utility, package, etc. to which your change belongs.
We can choose one of the predetermined scopes for the specific group if they exist, leave it blank or enter a new one on the fly.

> The predetermined scopes corresponds to current present projects, libraries or utilities inside the monorepo.
> Each time a library is created, it is added automatically to the `cz-config.cjs` file, under scopes list.
>
> **For each new app added, it must be added manually in the scopes list of the `cz-config.cjs`.**

#### 3. Enter the ticket number

Add the unique ID from your managing tool, in our case we are using [Github issues](https://github.com/features/issues).

#### 4. Description

- Brief description of the meaning and intention of the change, not the technical content.
- Written in imperative (`Imperative mood` in English).
- Do not capitalize on the first character.
- Do not put a final point.
- Maximum 100 characters.
- Do not repeat information already inferred in the steps of the group and scope.

#### 5. Longer description (optional)

- Must be separated by a subject line.
- Any information that the subject may complement should go here.
- We can write in multi-line.
- Adjust each line to 72 characters.
- Explain _what_ and _why_ instead of how.

#### 6. Issues closed (optional)

- Add the issue Id prefixed with '#' (like #54) if the next PR will close an open issue.

#### 6. Final confirmation

Commitizen will show us a summary of the commit message and ask for confirmation to proceed.

#### 7. Checking format with commitlint

[Commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint) checks that the message of the commit complies with the default format.

> **Tip:** In the same way any script added to a pre-commit hook or similar (linting, test ...), will be executed at this point.
