## Quick Reference

### Collection Design (CRITICAL)

- **coll-field-types**: Use appropriate field types (json for objects, select for enums)
- **coll-auth-vs-base**: Extend auth collection for users, base for non-auth data
- **coll-relations**: Use relation fields, not manual ID strings
- **coll-indexes**: Create indexes on frequently filtered/sorted fields
- **coll-view-collections**: Use views for complex aggregations
- **coll-geopoint**: Store coordinates as json field with lat/lng

### API Rules (CRITICAL)

- **rules-basics**: Always set API rules; empty = public access
- **rules-filter-syntax**: Use @request.auth, @collection, @now in rules
- **rules-request-context**: Access request data via @request.body, @request.query
- **rules-cross-collection**: Use @collection.name.field for cross-collection checks
- **rules-locked-vs-open**: Start locked, open selectively

### Authentication (CRITICAL)

- **auth-password**: Use authWithPassword for email/password login
- **auth-oauth2**: Configure OAuth2 providers via Admin UI
- **auth-token-management**: Store tokens securely, refresh before expiry
- **auth-mfa**: Enable MFA for sensitive applications
- **auth-impersonation**: Use impersonation for admin actions on behalf of users

### SDK Usage (HIGH)

- **sdk-initialization**: Initialize client once, reuse instance
- **sdk-auth-store**: Use AsyncAuthStore for React Native/SSR
- **sdk-error-handling**: Catch ClientResponseError, check status codes
- **sdk-auto-cancellation**: Disable auto-cancel for concurrent requests
- **sdk-filter-binding**: Use filter binding to prevent injection

### Query Performance (HIGH)

- **query-expand**: Expand relations to avoid N+1 queries
- **query-field-selection**: Select only needed fields
- **query-pagination**: Use cursor pagination for large datasets
- **query-batch-operations**: Batch creates/updates when possible

### Realtime (MEDIUM)

- **realtime-subscribe**: Subscribe to specific records or collections
- **realtime-events**: Handle create, update, delete events separately
- **realtime-auth**: Realtime respects API rules automatically
- **realtime-reconnection**: Implement reconnection logic

### File Handling (MEDIUM)

- **file-upload**: Use FormData for uploads, set proper content types
- **file-serving**: Use pb.files.getURL() for file URLs
- **file-validation**: Validate file types and sizes server-side

### Deployment (MEDIUM)

- **deploy-backup**: Schedule regular backups of pb_data
- **deploy-configuration**: Use environment variables for config
- **deploy-reverse-proxy**: Put behind nginx/caddy in production
- **deploy-sqlite-considerations**: Optimize SQLite for production workloads

## Example Prompts

Try these with your AI agent to see the skill in action:

**Building a new feature:**

- "Design a PocketBase schema for an e-commerce app with products, orders, and reviews"
- "Implement OAuth2 login with Google and GitHub for my app"
- "Build a real-time notification system with PocketBase subscriptions"
- "Create a file upload form with image validation and thumbnail previews"

**Fixing issues:**

- "My list query is slow on 100k records -- optimize it"
- "I'm getting 403 errors on my batch operations"
- "Fix the N+1 query problem in my posts list that loads author data in a loop"
- "My realtime subscriptions stop working after a few minutes"

**Security review:**

- "Review my API rules -- users should only access their own data"
- "Set up proper access control: admins manage all content, users edit only their own"
- "Are my authentication cookies configured securely for SSR?"
- "Audit my collection rules for IDOR vulnerabilities"

**Going to production:**

- "Configure Nginx with HTTPS, rate limiting, and security headers for PocketBase"
- "Set up automated backups for my PocketBase database"
- "Optimize SQLite settings for a production workload with ~500 concurrent users"
- "Deploy PocketBase with Docker Compose and Caddy"
